                        <p> <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                        and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

                        <p> <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language
                            such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                        <p> <strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                            This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation;
                            provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
